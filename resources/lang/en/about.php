    'p-apie' => 'UAB “Lisamora” was established in 2003. Our activity lasts for more than 13 years, so we

have gained a considerable experience in the installation of all types of bath, and we would like to

share it with you. Our progress was in line with the technological advances. We didn’t choose the easiest

way by producing several types of standard baths. We take into account each customer\'s individual

needs, expectations, visions and implement them successfully to justify even the demanding

customer expectations. Therefore, each of our designed, manufactured, built and equipped baths is

unique. 
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to customer\'s drawings we design, prepare a project, the estimate, and only upon

agreement with the customer, start to work. Designed baths segments we produce in our production

premises in Kaunas. The brigade of assemblers carries the prepared products to any corner of

Lithuania or Europe for the final installation. <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of manufactured items are installed by our

assembly specialists, who are working in the company since the first years of the company\'s

activity. Their experience let us avoid mistakes and ensures the quality of the final product. We are not afraid of challenges; we are waiting for you and your preferences. Contact us

and we will make sure your wishes become a reality.',
